# Bookshelf

**Bookshelf** is a place show some popular books.  At the moment, the
functionality is basic and not very appealing. Your main goal is to 
add features and improve UX. 

## Issues

Each of these issues exists as a github issue as well where you can
find more details and leave comments.  Click the Issues button at the
top of this page to view them.

### Add paging control

Currently, all books are displayed in a single page. So this page could
be very long. We need to break these books into different pages. For 
example, each page only shows ten books. User need to click *next* in order 
to see more books.

### More than one author

Apparntly, there is a problem in our bookshelf: one book can only have one
author which is absolutely not reasonable. Fix this problem and try to use tag
or filter to make code clean and easy to read.

### Real-time search

Instead of requiring the user to click "Search," results should appear as they type.

### Web service swap

If Yahoo! suddenly decides to shut off their music search service and we had to switch to another data source, how would you restructure our code?

## How to stand out
 - Improve UX and UI as mush as you can
 - Leave lots of comments on the issues as you think through things.
 - Commit and push frequently.
 - Comment your code
 - Refactor legacy code; in particular, describe each change and why you decided to change it.
 - DRY code

### Note: you are not allowed to use any library other than the ones already in the repository.
