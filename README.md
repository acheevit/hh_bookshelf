# Bookshelf

**Bookshelf** is a place show some popular books.  At the moment, the
functionality is basic and not very appealing. Your main goal is to 
add features and improve UX. 

## Issues

Each of these issues exists as a github issue as well where you can
find more details and leave comments.  Click the Issues button at the
top of this page to view them.

### Add paging control

Currently, all books are displayed in a single page. So this page could
be very long. We need to break these books into different pages. For 
example, each page only shows ten books. User need to click *next* in order 
to see more books.

### More than one author

Apparntly, there is a problem in our bookshelf: one book can only have one
author which is absolutely not reasonable. Fix this problem and try to use tag
or filter to make code clean and easy to read.

### Only available to your country

Consider our bookshelf can only show to users in your country, an error
page will be showed to others. How to do this?

### New book form

There are always good books we don't have, so we'd like to have a form
provided to users where they can tell us new books information.
We also need to review this information and add them to our bookshelf if the
information is right. You can write review page youself or use Admin interface in Django, you decide.
Security problems may exist because we will expose form to anonymous users. 
How to avoid it?

## How to stand out
 - Improve UX and UI as mush as you can
 - Leave lots of comments on the issues as you think through things.
 - Commit and push frequently.
 - Comment your code
 - Refactor legacy code; in particular, describe each change and why you decided to change it.
 - DRY code
